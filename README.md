<h1>Telco Customer Churn Prediction</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Telco Customer Churn Prediction project. This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Churn prediction is a critical task for businesses to retain their customers and make data-driven decisions to reduce attrition rates.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>

<p>The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Data Source Name/Link]. It contains information about Telco customers, including demographics, service subscriptions, and customer churn status. The dataset is structured with various features, including both numerical and categorical variables.</p>

<p>Preprocessing of the dataset involved several steps:
    <ul>
        <li>Handling Missing Values: Identified and addressed missing values, ensuring data integrity.</li>
        <li>Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical variables such as 'gender,' 'contract type,' and 'payment method' were encoded to numerical values for model compatibility.</li>
        <li>Scaling Numerical Features: Numerical features were scaled to have a consistent range for improved model performance.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

<p>During the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, key insights were uncovered:
    <ul>
        <li>Summary Statistics: Basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation were calculated for numerical variables.</li>
        <li>Data Visualizations: Visualizations like histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices were created to better understand the data distribution and relationships.</li>
        <li>Churn Analysis: Churn rates were analyzed with respect to different customer attributes to identify potential patterns and trends.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Model Building</h2>

<p>Several machine learning models were employed for churn prediction, including:
    <ul>
        <li>Logistic Regression: A basic classification model used for predicting churn status.</li>
        <li>Decision Tree Classifier: A decision tree-based model used for more complex decision boundaries.</li>
        <li>LightGBM Classifier: A gradient boosting model known for its efficiency and predictive power.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Hyperparameters and model configurations were fine-tuned to achieve the best performance.</p>

<h2>Model Evaluation</h2>

<p>Model evaluation was conducted using various performance metrics such as:
    <ul>
        <li>Accuracy: Overall accuracy of the models in predicting churn.</li>
        <li>Precision: The ability of the models to correctly predict positive churn cases.</li>
        <li>Recall: The ability of the models to capture all actual positive churn cases.</li>
        <li>F1-Score: A combination of precision and recall to measure the model's overall performance.</li>
        <li>Confusion Matrices: Visualizations of model predictions versus actual churn status.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, the Telco Customer Churn Prediction project successfully explored, preprocessed, and built predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning. Key findings and feature importance were discussed, providing valuable insights for the business to take targeted actions to reduce churn rates. Further enhancements and model improvements can be considered for future work.</p>
